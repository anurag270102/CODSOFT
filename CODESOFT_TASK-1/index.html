            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p><span>N</span>ikola Tesla, (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]—died January
                7, 1943, New York, New York, U.S.), Serbian American inventor and engineer who discovered and patented
                the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating-current machinery. He also developed the
                three-phase system of electric power transmission. He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and sold
                the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George
                Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.</p>

            <div class="bio">
                <div>
                    <h4>Early Life</h4>
                    <p>Famous Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in what is now Smiljan,
                        Croatia. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was likely spurred by his mother, Djuka
                        Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up.
                        Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a priest. After studying in the 1870s at the Realschule,
                        Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt); the Polytechnic
                        Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague, Tesla began preparing for a trip to
                        America.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Famed Inventor</h4>
                    <p>Tesla came to the United States in 1884, and soon began working with famed inventor and business
                        mogul Thomas Edison. The two worked together for a brief period before parting ways due to a
                        conflicting business-scientific relationship, attributed by historians to their incredibly
                        different personalities: While Edison was a power figure who focused on marketing and financial
                        success, Tesla was a commercially out-of-tune and somewhat vulnerable, yet extremely pivotal
                        inventor, who pioneered some of history's most important inventions. His inventions include the
                        "Tesla coil," developed in 1891, and an alternating-current electrical system of generators,
                        motors and transformers—both of which are still used widely today.</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Death and Legacy</h4>
                    <p>Poor and reclusive, Nikola Tesla died on January 7, 1943, at the age of 86, in New York
                        City—where he had lived for nearly 60 years. His legacy, however, has been thriving for more
                        than a century, and will undoubtedly live on for decades to come.</p>
                    <p>Several books and films have highlighted Tesla's life and famous works, including Nikola Tesla,
                        The Genius Who Lit the World, a film created by the Tesla Memorial Society and the Nikola Tesla
                        Museum in Belgrade, Serbia; and The Secret of Nikola Tesla, which stars Orson Welles as John
                        Pierpont Morgan (J.P. Morgan). In recent years, a street sign entitled "Nikola Tesla Corner" was
                        installed in honor of the famous inventor, near the 40th Street-6th Avenue intersection in New
                        York City.</p>

                                            in automobiles, Tesla decided to develop his own turbine-style engine.
                                            Also known as the boundary-layer turbine and cohesion-type turbine,
                                            Tesla’s turbine was distinct in its design. Unlike conventional turbines
                                            Tesla’s design was bladeless, instead employing smooth discs rotating in
                                            a chamber to generate movement.</p>

                                            a lab in Colorado Springs in 1899, he had the space and resources to
                                            create the biggest Tesla coil yet. He called this triple coil system the
                                            magnifying transmitter. It was 52 feet in diameter, generated millions
                                            of volts of electricity and produced 130-foot-long lightning bolts.</p>

                                            was his influence on the development of alternating current (AC).
                                            Perhaps it shouldn’t, strictly speaking, feature in a list of his
                                            inventions, but there’s no doubt that his technology was instrumental in
                                            the emergence of AC as the world’s dominant electrical system. </p>

                                            the emergence of X-ray technology. Famously, German scientist Wilhelm
                                            Conrad Röntgen developed the first X-ray on the 8 November of that same
